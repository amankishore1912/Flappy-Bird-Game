## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

This repository contains a basic implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game using Java. The game features a simple, yet addictive gameplay loop where the player controls a bird by tapping the screen to make it flap, avoiding obstacles along the way.

Key features:

- Classic Flappy Bird gameplay mechanics.
- Basic graphics and sound effects.
- Score tracking and high score system.
- Simple game over and restart functionality.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

To run the above game into your system, follow the below steps: 
- Clone the repository.
- Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.
- Run the main class to start the game.

Note: This project serves as a starting point for learning game development in Java. It can be extended with additional features, improved graphics, and sound effects.

Feel free to contribute by:
- Submitting bug reports
- Suggesting new features
- Improving the code quality

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management
